                <p>Hi [First Name],</p>
                <p>I've helped a lot of people buy homes over the years, and there are a few things I wish everyone knew before they started their search. So here's my quick list:</p>
                <p><strong>1. Get pre-approved early</strong> - It's not just about knowing your budget; sellers take you way more seriously.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Don't skip the inspection</strong> - Ever. Trust me on this one.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Think about resale value</strong> - Even if this is your "forever home," life happens.</p>
                <p><strong>4. The first offer isn't always the best offer</strong> - Sometimes patience pays off.</p>
                <p><strong>5. It's okay to be picky</strong> - You're making a huge investment. Take your time.</p>
                <p>Want to dive deeper into any of these? I'm always happy to chat and answer questions.</p>
                <p>Also, if you haven't gotten pre-approved yet, I know some great lenders who can help. Just say the word!</p>

                <p>Hey [First Name],</p>
                <p>I wanted to share a quick success story with you!</p>
                <p>Last month, I worked with [Client Name] who was in a similar situation to yours. They were looking for [similar criteria] and were feeling pretty discouraged after a few months of searching.</p>
                <p>Long story short - we found them an amazing place in [Area], and they closed last week! Here's what they said:</p>
                <p><em>"[Your Name] was incredible. Patient, knowledgeable, and always had our best interests at heart. We couldn't have done this without them!"</em></p>
                <p>What made the difference? We got really clear on their must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, expanded the search area just slightly, and moved quickly when the right property came along.</p>
                <p>I'd love to create the same kind of experience for you. How's your search going so far? Anything I can help with?</p>
