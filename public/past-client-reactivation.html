                That's up [X]% from this time last year!</p>
                <p>📊 <strong>Your estimated home value:</strong><br>
                Based on recent sales, your home at [Address] is estimated to be worth around $[Range]. That means you've gained approximately $[Amount] in equity since you bought it!</p>
                <p>⏱️ <strong>Market conditions:</strong><br>
                Homes are selling in an average of [X] days - [interpretation of whether this is fast/slow and what it means].</p>

                    <strong>What does this mean for you?</strong><br><br>
