                <p><strong>Not the right fit?</strong><br>
                That's okay too! I have access to every listing in the area and can set up a custom search based on exactly what you're looking for. You'll get alerts the moment new properties hit the market.</p>
                
                <p>Either way, I'd love to stay in touch and help you find the perfect home - whether it's this one or another property.</p>

                <p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
