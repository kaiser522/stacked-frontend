                    The comparable sales indicate a range of $X to $Y. We can certainly try your preferred price, but I need you to understand the likely outcome: extended time on market, multiple price reductions, and potentially selling for less than if we price strategically from the start.

                    I'm committed to getting you the highest possible price the market will bear. Can we discuss a pricing strategy that balances your goals with market realities?"

                The market has spoken, and it's saying our current price isn't aligned with buyer expectations. I have three recommendations:

                1. Reduce price to $[amount] to generate renewed interest
                2. Make strategic improvements to justify current price
                3. Wait and hope market conditions change

                Homes sell at market value, not at the price we want or need. The longer we wait, the more 'stale' the listing becomes, and we often end up selling for less than if we'd priced correctly earlier.
