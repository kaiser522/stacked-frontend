                    • Get pre-approved first (I have some great lender recommendations)<br>
                    • Start looking at 3-4 neighborhoods to get a feel for the market<br>
                    • Be ready to move quickly when we find the right one<br><br>
                    
                    The market's been pretty active lately, but there are definitely good opportunities for buyers who are prepared.<br><br>

                    Hey [First Name],<br><br>
                    
                    I was putting together some market reports and thought you'd be interested to know what's been happening in your neighborhood.<br><br>
                    
                    Your home at [Address] has likely appreciated to around $[New Estimate] based on recent sales nearby. That's up about [Percentage]% from when you bought it!<br><br>
                    
                    Not suggesting you should sell - just thought you'd like to know you made a great investment. The [Neighborhood] market has been really strong.<br><br>
                    
                    Hope you and the family are doing well!<br><br>

                    It's been a while since we last talked about your home search. I know life gets busy and sometimes the timing just isn't right.<br><br>
                    
                    I wanted to check in and see if you're still looking, or if your plans have changed. No worries either way - just don't want you to think I forgot about you!<br><br>
                    
                    If you're still in the market, I've got some new listings that might be worth a look. If not, no problem at all.<br><br>
                    
                    Either way, hope you're doing well.<br><br>
