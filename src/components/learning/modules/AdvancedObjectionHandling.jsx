                        When a prospect says "I want to think about it" or "Your commission is too high," they're actually saying "I'm interested, but you haven't convinced me yet."

                                    In my experience, professional marketing, negotiation, and market positioning typically results in 4-8% higher sale prices. That means you actually keep more money, even after paying a full commission.<br /><br />
