                                "I understand this is frustrating. Nobody wants to reduce their price. But here's what I know after [X] years in this business:
                                <br /><br />
                                Homes sell at market value, not at the price we want or need. The longer we wait, the more 'stale' the listing becomes, and we often end up selling for less than if we'd priced correctly earlier.
                                <br /><br />
                                I'd rather help you get $[realistic amount] in the next 30 days than chase $[current price] for months and potentially get less. What matters most - the price or actually selling?"
